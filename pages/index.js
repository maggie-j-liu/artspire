            We believe that creativity should never be limited by the lack of
            resources at hand. This website not only caters towards that lack,
            but also addresses environmental issues. Our curated collection of
            art ideas will help you to create stunning masterpieces with items
            that otherwise would have gone in the wastebin. In an environmental
            friendly and budget friendly way, this website will help you to
            unlock your artistic potential, regardless of what materials you
            have on hand. With Artspire, you'll never have to worry about not
            having the "right" materials again - all you need is a little
            inspiration(which this website will give) and a willingness to
            experiment!
